	<h6>Format</h6>
	<p>The NEMO consists of two rounds, an individual and team round. The individual round consists of 20 short answer problems to be done in 60 minutes. The team round consists of 12 short answer problems and a minigame to be completed in 30 minutes. The difficulty of both tests is approximately the same as that of an AMC 12.</p>
	<br>
	<h6>Materials</h6>
	<p>Any materials allowed when taking the AMC10/12 will be allowed on this contest. This includes scratch paper, graph paper, rulers, compass, protractors, writing utensils, and erasers. In particular, no calculators, phones, or other computing devices are allowed. No problems on this contest will require the use of a calculator.</p>
	<br>
	<h6>Scoring</h6>
	<p><b>Individual Score: </b>An individual's score will be the sum of the point values of the problems answered correctly on the individual round. Point values for the problems will be determined after the contest based on the number of correct submissions, with problems solved by fewer contestants having a higher weight.</p>
	<p><b>Team Round Score: </b>A team's score will be the sum of the point values of the problems answered correctly, multiplied by a multiplier generated by their performance on the minigame. Point values for the short answer problems will be pre-determined and indicated on the test. A description of the scoring procedure for the minigame will also be included on the test.</p> 
	<p><b>Team Score: </b>A team's score will be the sum of their team round score and all four members' individual scores. (If the team has fewer than four members, the remaining individual scores will be counted as zeroes.)</p>
	<p><b>School Score: </b>A school's score will be the weighted sum of the individual scores and team subscores from that school. The highest score in each category will have the highest multiplier, the second highest score will have the second highest multiplier, and so on. Therefore, it is equally important that students score well and that a school have high participation in order to have a high school score.</p>
